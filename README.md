Vision & Purpose

This project is the foundation of a backend framework built entirely from scratch, with no external web framework, no shortcuts, and no abstractions hidden behind libraries.

The ambition is clear:
to progressively reach a level of functionality, flexibility, and robustness comparable to frameworks like Django or Flask, while keeping full control over every internal mechanism.

This is not an experiment.
This is a long-term engineering effort.

What This Project Is (and Will Become)

http-socket-from-scratch is designed to evolve into:

A complete HTTP server implementation

A routing system

A request / response abstraction

Middleware handling

Native socket-based concurrency

Extensible architecture for future features (auth, templating, APIs, etc.)

All of this will be implemented step by step, with a strong focus on:

correctness

readability

learning value

architectural discipline

The goal is not to compete with existing frameworks, but to understand and rebuild their foundations.

How to Run

The framework is intentionally simple to launch.

To start the server:

python server.py


Once launched, the server can be accessed from any web browser by navigating to the configured host and port.

No build step.
No dependencies.
Just Python and the network.

Design Philosophy

Pure Python: no external frameworks

Explicit over magic

Low-level control over sockets and HTTP

Progressive complexity, added only when justified

Human-written code, meant to be read and understood

This project exists to push back against over-automation and rediscover the fundamentals of backend engineering.

Development Timeline

This repository will be actively developed over the coming months.
Expect breaking changes, refactors, and architectural shifts as the framework matures.

Stability will come later.
Understanding comes first.

Final Note

This project is a statement as much as it is a codebase.

A reminder that before frameworks, there were protocols.
Before abstractions, there were sockets.
And before productivity, there was mastery.

(Of course I had to make such a beautiful quote at the end I'm an elegant man after all)

Don't forget "Science is elegant"
Peace and love!!
